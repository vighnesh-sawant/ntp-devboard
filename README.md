# A devboard with a gps module and ethernet
This devboard will work as stratum 1 NTP server and has support for PTP also which I plan on supporting. Since this is my first hardware project I have picked simple(?) components

# Why
Mostly for fun but I WANT MY LAPTOP TO HAVE MORE ACCURATE TIME THAN MY FRIENDS.
I used to do this same thing with a phone but its accuracy was on the same level as ntp over the public internet  
Thats why I wanted my own STRATUM 1 Server

# How
Get this pcb printed, make sure to get a gps module with a PPS pin and connect the pins via breadboard / soldering   
to the gpio pins of the rp2040, then use my firmware and connect the ethernet cable to your pc.  
More instrucions coming after I get my PCB printed!
